Here's who we are

---

(something along these lines I think is worth saying)

We make a lot of websites

Neither of us is a web developer

We use R Markdown!

And here's who we think you are...
* Educator with RMDs
*
* Probably started doing a lot of online teaching recently

# Why sharing on short notice?

--

- you have files

--

- you need to teach

--

- you need to share your files with other people

---

# Why make a course website?

# Good news

R markdown is made for sharing

---

# Better news

HTML makes sharing even easier with a `r emo::ji("star")`link`r emo::ji("star")` and...

--

R Markdown can be knitted into HTML! `r emo::ji("rocket")`

---

# What does sharing look like?

(gif of file window, click on .Rproj file to open and open up index.Rmd; have TOC floating and flatly theme already done)

???

Let's start with a single Rmd file, inside an folder that is also an R project

# What does an Rmd look like?

metadata = YAML

text = markdown

# What does a *shareable* Rmd look like?

gif- knit to html

???

Use kap for a gif --- should end at produced HTML

dont forget to host gif-url elsewhere

---

# What does a *shareable* Rmd look like?

screenshot- knitted html, pretty

???

but still trapped on your computer


---

# What does a *linkable* Rmd look like?

some image here on left of laptop, on right big computer in the sky (anything like that from keeya that can be reused?)

???

First, we need a big computer in the clouds, otherwise known as a web server.

---

# What does a *linkable* Rmd look like?

screenshot netlify 

url typed out so easy to find, like:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://summer-of-blogdown.netlify.com/01/#42")
```


???

For this webinar, we'll use sky computers provided by Netlify.

---

# What does a *linkable* Rmd look like?

gif -- all the way through getting a link.

Frankenstein - it's alive! image

???

Has kind of a crazy name, but you can now send this to whomever you'd like.


---

# What just happened?

something like...


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://summer-of-blogdown.netlify.com/01/#44")
```



---

# Sharing = knit + drop -> LINK

???

Sharing your R Markdown means two things:

1. Knit to HTML

1. Transfer to web server



---

# Goals

```{r echo=FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("https://picsum.photos/id/1600/900")
```
 Give you a quick tour around what is possible to do with your RMD docs when turning them into a *web*site.

FAST SLIDE
And our goals are to show you how to quickly take that R Markdown and put it online the fastest and most straightforward way possible.

We've just shown you how to go from a regular RMD doc on your computer to one that's a webpage.

We'll talk show you 4 RMD tools that are for turning a *COLLECTION* of RMDs into a website.

# R Markdown site

Looks like this...

Screenshot of rendered html site (w/ theme)


---

# R Markdown site

same screenshot, annotated

**Minimum** required files:

1. `index.Rmd` = Landing page

1. `_site.yml` = Navbar / theme 

--

**Optional** but likely:

+ Other `.Rmd` files = Content 

???

say somewhere: every .Rmd is a page, but the one named index.Rmd is a special page

---

# Where is the site?

build with button

---

# How do you share this site?

Drag-and-drop `docs/`

# But...

(maybe a good place also for cinderella- carriage goes poof)

Only exists for 24 hours. 

Need to make a Netlify account to make it stick.

---

# Back to Netlify

Make an account.

# Inside the Rmds

.Rmd files look just like you think...

+ now there are just many of them, but 

+ remember: index is special 

???

Metadata = YAML
text = markdown
code = R

---

# Inside the `_site.yml`

```{r echo=FALSE}
yml_empty() %>%
  yml_navbar(
    title = "rstats101",
    left = list(
      navbar_page("Home", href = "index.html"),
      navbar_page("Syllabus", href = "syllabus.html")
    )) %>% 
  yml_output(html_document(toc = TRUE, toc_float = TRUE, theme = "flatly")) %>% 
  asis_yaml_output()
```

# Distill site

**Minimum** required files:

1. `index.Rmd` = Landing page

1. `_site.yml` = Navbar

--

**Optional** but likely:

+ Other `.Rmd` files = Content

--

But also!

+ `_posts/` = Nice!

???

Say out loud- actually the same as Rmd site, minus themes based on bootstrap.

---

# A blog?

listing page stuff here, yml goes on left for `index.Rmd` in `_posts/` folder, on right is screenshot of output

---

# Where is the site?

???

actually the same as Rmd site!

# How do you share this site?

Drag-and-drop `docs/`
