# Goals

![](https://picsum.photos/id/1600/900)&lt;!-- --&gt;
 Give you a quick tour around what is possible to do with your existing RMD docs when turning them into a site.

FAST SLIDE
And our goals are to show you how to quickly take that R Markdown and put it online the fastest and most straightforard way possible.

We've just shown you how to go from a regular RMD doc on your computer to one that's a webpage.

We'll talk show you 4 RMD tools that are for turning a *COLLECTION* of RMDs into a website.

# An RMD site

Looks like this...

[quick gif, not full screen, the sample site]
[just a "have you seen me before?"]

???

---
class: center, left

# How to make it

### Add content
### Put pages together
### Share

---
# Add Content

## Where do my RMDs go?
These go in the project root directory

This is what you know. Each RMD becomes its own page.

Ex: 
* index.Rmd
* Class1.Rmd
* Class2.Rmd
* Homework1.Rmd

---

# Add Content

## Do I need to change them?

Nope! 

But make sure that the RMD you want to be your "home page" is renamed index.RMD

---

# Put pages together

### How does the site know what pages to show my learners?

`_site.yml`

Orchestra director

???

This is new, and important. It's the RMD doc's frontmatter YAML in standalone doc form

It acts like the orchestra conductor --puts all the pages together in the way you want. How?

---

### Take a peek at _site.yml

Screenshot of _site.yml

--

Screenshot of navbar

--

Annotation showing how _site.yml controls what you see in NAv

???

It creates your navbar.
If you want to "hide" an RMD from learners, then leave it off your _site.yml

---

### Let's add a new page

Quick gif demo 

Adding class3.rmd 

???
if time allows?

---

# FYI _site.yml

You can also add: 
* Dropdown menus
* Icons
* Code folding and Code download


???

There's a YAML line for all of these options

---

# Sharing 

When you knit, your HTML folders all go into docs/

???
Back to the sample site, GIF of knitting &gt; demo drag n drop docs folder. 

---

# And we can change the domain name 

???

Gif continues showing how this is done

# RMD Site Pros and Cons

Pros
.pull-left[

* You don't have to change your existing RMD docs much at all
* Bootstrap, aka out-of-the-box themes, toc, and code_download
* Low dependencies

]

Cons
.pull-right[

* File organization
* Manual Menus
* Low customizability without lots of CSS work

]

# DISTILL

???
Transition slide


---
class: middle, center

# A Distill site

Looks like this...

[quick gif tour, not full screen, the sample site]
[just a "have you seen me before?"]

???

Some new features to point out during "tour" :
* Citations, Appendicies, Footnotes
* Blog feature -- organize by date

---

# How to get it

`install.packages("distill")`

Extends RMD functionality by adding Distill framework

---

# Where do my RMD docs go?

A Distill site (without the blog) is going to be very similar to an RMD site. Put your Main site files in the project root directory.

Each page in your nav/ menu should be in _site.yml 

---

# What about blog RMDs? Where do they go?

A few extra bits for a blog section. They all live in: 

(1) _posts/

Screenshot or directory tree thing

OR just show that `distill::create_post("My Awesome Post")` creates the appropriate structure for you. Then paste in whatever .RMd content you want. 

???

The blog "arm" of the distill site lives in the _posts/ folder. Then there has to be another folder for each blog post you make, that will house the post's .Rmd + images etc.

---
# Do I need to change my RMDs?

Barely!

```
output: 
 distill::distill_article
```

* Need to make sure you have an index.Rmd in root = landing
* individual RMDs HAve to have ^ in their frontmatter YAML.
* knit each article individually once you've added it or made changes

---

# Consider adding...

Screenshot of Distill post with annotations that highlight the following. With color-coded arrows indicating whether you add it through the YAML frontmatter or in the doc itself.

* citations 
* gutter notes
* appendices
* categories in the metadata


???

---

# Put pages together

### How does the site know what pages to show my learner?

* same as RMD still `_site.yml` is our orchestra director
* point out output directory here? (maybe?)

Screenshot probably
---

# Put pages together

### Blog post specific: 

Screenshot of blog listing page with:

```
---
title: "About this blog"
description: |
  This won't show up
listing: posts

---
```
???

* Note: Need to have a "blog" listing .Rmd and page
* No real content, just a YAML:

---

# Sharing

* Build your site with Build Tab
* Drag and drop _site/ folder 

???

Gif

---

# What about updating?

* Demo a common mistake. And how to fix it. 
* I forgot to knit my blog post class3.Rmd. My previous drag and drop is missing it!
* Re-knit -- drag and drop again


---
# Distill Pros and Cons

.pull-left[

* Sleek styling with no effort
* BLog posts with categories make it easy for users to sort through content
* Technical features like footnotes, citations, etc.

]

.pull-right [

* Each blog post needs to be knit independently of building the site
* Navbar .RMDs are all still in your root directory. Could get messy
* Not easy to customize styling

]

# A Bookdown site

Looks like this...

[quick gif tour, not full screen, the sample site]
[just a "have you seen me before?"]

???

Some new features to point out during "tour" :
* A very long TOC
* Chapters 
* Sections

---

# How to get it

```
#install.packages("bookdown")
library(bookdown)
```

---
# Key Files


All your RMD content 

--

3 YAMLs

-- 

1 of them is index.Rmd

---

???

Brace yourselves because the bookdown structure is weirder than what we've seen. 



# Key Files

## Where do my RMD Files GO?

![](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/images/screenshots/bookdown-skeleton-files.jpg)
???

For example... a directory that looks like this.

Your RMDs will be in the root. The first one is still index.Rmd. This becomes the first page of your book. Usually an preface or Intro.

The REst of the RMDs are numbered. These each become book chapters. 

---
# Do I need to change the RMDs?

Yes. 

* You (might) need to rename all the files to have a numerical order. 
* All chapter .Rmd files MUST begin with a `# Level 1 Header` no matter what. No front matter YAMLS.

---

# ...here's why

(maybe if time allows)

![](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/images/illos/Bookdown-file-flow.jpg)

---

# How does bookdown know what to do with the rest?

The other 3 YAMLS

### `_output.yml`

### `_bookdown.yml`

### The YAML in `index.Rmd`

???

include a Graphic which bullets which doc lets you change what

* To hide a chapter while it is in progress, put it in a subfolder or start the .Rmd filename with an `_`.

---

# Share

Build your book with the Build tab. 

_book/ --&gt; drag and drop

???

By now you probably get the picture.

---

# Pros and Cons of Bookdown

.pull-left[

* Long-form content friendly
* Clear ordering of content
* Cross-references
* Numbered figures, equations, tables

]

.pull-right [

* Three YAMLS (time consuming to set up)
* Project directory will have many RMDs and no good way to organize them into subdirectories
* Not easy to customize styling

]

# Blogdown

---

...is more intense, but here's what's possible.

???

Gif of blogdown

---

We won't go into the key files for this, but a main PRO of blogdown is that you get to have organized directories and subdirections. 

* Junk drawer vs Container Store

# HEre's a shortcut you can use
