Alison is a developmental psychologist

Desirée is a neuroscientist

Neither of us is a web developer

But we both ship a lot of websites for teaching data science.

Here are just a few of them.

Here's who we think you are...

* You're an educator

* You have R Markdown files for teaching...

* But they're stuck on your computer, and you need to share them easily with others. 

* And--- you probably have a new classroom space that looks like this-- so sharing needs to be done 100% online

## Why make a course website?

--

&lt;img src="images/rawpixel/fortress.jpg" width="444" /&gt;

???

+ Shareable

+ Reproducible

+ Resilient

Why make a course website at all?  It makes your content shareable, reproducible, and resilient [to short-notice changes]

Saving here for now:
The good news is that R markdown is made for sharing

R Markdown can be knitted into websites

and websites can be shared easily with a single link

But before we talk about full course website, first we need to talk about single R Markdown files. So I'll pass it off to Desiree to get us started. 

---
template: clouds

# What does an .Rmd file look like?

???

Jumping right in, let's take a look at a single R Markdown file for a Lab lesson.

---
class: center, middle

&lt;img src="images/screenshots/Rproj1.png" width="544" /&gt;

???

Let's start by opening up the folder where the specific lab content lives.

---
class: center middle

&lt;img src="images/screenshots/Rproj2.png" width="544" /&gt;


???
and inside of it, you'll notice that this folder is an **R Project** (which we strongly recommend you use).

We can click on the RProj file, which will port us into RStudio... 

---
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd.png)
background-size: contain
class: middle, center

???

...where we can see our single R Markdown file for our lab. 

---
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd0.png)
background-size: contain
class: middle, center

???

And it's made up of some metadata, which we call the YAML. The YAML has different "keys".

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd1.png)
background-size: contain

???

One of these Keys is the TITLE, and we say that it gets the *value* of `Lab 02: MoMA Museum Tour`.

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd2.png)
background-size: contain

???

Our YAML also has a section all about output. Here's where we specify what format we want (in this case, an HTML document). 


---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd3.png)
background-size: contain

???

But we can also spell out some output options as well -- like whether we'd like a table of contents to be automatically generated.  

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd4.png)
background-size: contain

???

The rest of the R Markdown document might have some text in the form of markdown.

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd5.png)
background-size: contain

???

and oftentimes, code. 


???

So this is an R Markdown document --but it doesn't yet look like something we'd want to share.

---
template: clouds

# What does a .emphasis[shareable] .Rmd look like?

---
class: top center

&lt;video width="1530" height="610" controls&gt;
    &lt;source src="images/single-doc-knit.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt; &lt;/video&gt;

???

Of course, the real magic happens, when we click on the Knit icon, and see our file turned into HTML. 

So, here's what that looks like: 

+ We knit
+ We can watch in this bottom pane as our R Markdown document gets processed.
+ And voila! -- we see our rendered HTML file. 
+ We can choose to open this up in a real browser window.
+ And then just test a few things out. 

---
class: middle center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-knit1.png)
background-size: contain

--

&lt;img src="images/screenshots/Single-knit2.png" style="

"&gt;

--

&lt;img src="images/screenshots/Single-knit3.png" style="

&lt;img src="images/screenshots/Single-knit4.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 73%; 
  bottom: 10px;
  right: 80px;
"&gt;

???

Okay, so here's a screenshot of the same rendered file in our browser, and now we can see how some of the keys in our YAML affected our document: 

+ The font and colors that we see are from a theme that we added in the output. 

+ And we also have this nice table of contents that sticks to the left side of the window -- that's also from options that we set in our YAML.

This looks great, and is now in a format that we probably wouldn't mind sharing--BUT--- it's still local and stuck on our computer. This up here is just the file path to where this HTML file lives in my R project.

We need a **link** that we can give our learners. 

---
class: center middle

## What does a .emphasis[linkable] Rmd look like?

--

&lt;img src="images/hello-index.jpg" width="570" /&gt;

???

So then what does a *linkable* RMD look like? There are two pre-requisites: 

1. You have to make sure we have an R Markdown document is named `index.Rmd` -- an internet browser will always begin by looking for a file named index to open up first. 

---

2. We need a web server, which is basically (as Heather Nolis described it at her conf talk this year)--- [CLICK] a big computer in the clouds.

And for this webinar, we'll use servers provided by Netlify.

(h/t Heather Nolis: https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/we-re-hitting-r-a-million-times-a-day-so-we-made-a-talk-about-it-heather-nolis-dr-jacqueline-nolis)

So, I'll demo this in a second, but essentially,if you go to this link, you can drag and drop an HTML file, and Netlify will host it online. Let's see what this looks like...


---

&lt;video width="1200" height="625" controls&gt;
    &lt;source src="images/single-doc-dnd.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
???

So on the lef I have my Lab02 R Project folder, which has the HTML file we knit a bit ago. 

And then in my browser, I'll go to app.netlify.com/drop -- and  drag n drop the folder in. 

A few seconds later, Netlify has  auto-generated a silly-name link and deployed our page -- this link is where our Lab02 page now lives,  and you can share your page with whomever you choose --  hooray!

## Sharing = index + knit + drop -&gt; LINK

Sharing your R Markdown means three things:

1. Have an index.Rmd

1. Knit to HTML

1. Transfer to web server

So let's begin with an R Markdown site.

&lt;img src="images/Circle-nav.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 16%; 
  top: 126px;
  left: 253px;
"&gt;

???

Here's what one looks like out in the wild. And if you remember our single R Markdown page, this doesn't look that different.

The main difference is that we have a navbar at the top -- with links that will take us to other pages.


---
class: center middle
background-color: #f5ede4

&lt;https://apreshill.github.io/data-vis-labs-2018&gt;

&lt;img src= "images/screenshots/RMD-site-wild1.png" 
  style="
    position: absolute; 
    width: 103%; 
    top: 2px;

Link to other pages, including one's you've made.

???

But you can also link to external pages here too, like this one here which in this case goes to a learning management system.

```

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="images/rproj.png" width="325" /&gt;

]
???

So let's build a minimal R Markdown site of our own. 

Imagine that this box on the left is the list of files that are inside of our R Project folder. 

Let's take a look inside some of these...

---
name: build2

## Build your site

└── lab02.Rmd
```
]


.pull-right[
&lt;img src="images/hello-index.jpg" width="570" /&gt;
]

???

Just like before when we created a single page, we have an `index.Rmd` file. 

---
name: build3

## Build your site

.pull-left[


```r
.
├── rstats101.Rproj
├── _site.yml
├── index.Rmd

*└── lab02.Rmd
```
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="images/rmd-friends.jpg" width="449" /&gt;
]

???

But now there are a few other R Markdown files, too. 


---
name: build4

## Build your site

.pull-left[


```r
.
├── rstats101.Rproj
*├── _site.yml
├── index.Rmd 
├── schedule.Rmd 
├── lab01.Rmd 
└── lab02.Rmd 
```
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="images/Q.jpg" width="388" /&gt;
]

???

And you might not recognize this file. That's new...

---
name: build5

## Build your site

.left-column[


```r
.
├── rstats101.Rproj
*├── _site.yml
├── index.Rmd 
├── schedule.Rmd

└── lab02.Rmd 
```
]

.right-column[
&lt;img src="images/screenshots/build-site.png" style="margin-top: -28px;"&gt;
]

???

But before we dig deeper into the files here, let's knit all the pages in our R Markdown site in one fell swoop. 

To do that, you can mouse over to the Build Tab in the IDE and then click "Build Website".

---
name: build6

## Build your site

.left-column[

```r
.
├── rstats101.Rproj

└── lab02.Rmd 
```
]

.right-column[
&lt;img src="images/screenshots/build-site-after.png" style="margin-top: -28px"&gt;
]

(note: RMD site in viewer pane is NOT the default setting)

???

So after we've built our site, we'll see a lot of output in the Build pane, and it's also possible to see a preview of your site in the Viewer pane. 

And now let's look at our directory tree -- there's a new folder that was made. This is the `_site/` folder, and it holds all the HTML files that were just knit. 

Let's see what our site looks like...

---
class: center top
background-color: #f5ede4

## R Markdown site

![](images/screenshots/RMD-site.png)
???

Here is the site we just built. We have a navbar and a theme that will apply to all pages on our site -- and even a dropdown menu!

Let's look under the hood and see some of the site's source code, starting with the index.

---
background-image: url("images/rawpixel/bunch-balloons-rmd1.jpg")

## Inside the `index.Rmd`

├── _site/ 
├── _site.yml
*├── index.Rmd
├── schedule.Rmd 
├── lab01.Rmd
└── lab02.Rmd
```
]

???

Remember that the index.Rmd is a special R Markdown documen--- because In any site, whatever file is named `index` will be treated as the homepage.  

So if our site was a big bunch of hot air ballons, `index` would be the main one of them all.

If we take a peek inside index, you'll notice that the YAML is much more pared down-- 

 but in fact, it doesn't have to be -- Here we're only using a key for the title, but we could have kept the exact same YAML that we had a single RMD document or we even gotten rid of that and had no YAML at all-- depending on what information we want to show. The meta data we include in each document is flexible in an RMD site. 

(We'll see why next.)

Next up, we have `_site.yml`: this is the site's configuration page, and it is basically is a YAML to rule all other RMD YAMLS in our site.

It is because of this file, that our index page (and all other RMDs in our site) can be so-pared down.

In our balloon analogy, `_site.yml` is the basket that is bringing all the ballon strings together.

Let's take a look inside...

Alright, let's pause a little longer here and walk through this:

* If you've only ever worked with a single R MArkdown file before, then you've maybe never seen `navbar:` as a YAML key. As you might expect, all of the options indented under here are what build our navbar:
    
    + The first line gives a title to our site, and creates the link in the navbar to go to the homepage.
    
    + The next thing is `left:`, and this assigns your navbar links will go on the left side immediately next to the the site title. (but you can also choose `right:`)
    
    + Underneath are nested YAML keys where we spell out what items we want in the navbar. 
    
    + Whenever you make a new R MArkdown document, if you want it to show up in  your navbar, you have to remember to add a reference to it here! (Alison can interject here about forgetting to do this). 
    
    + So say I have an R Markdown document with Syllabus information. I put in the text that I want for its link in the navbar. And then I have to tell _site.yml what the link's destination should be -- that's its `href:` (stands for hypertext reference). 
    
    **note!** the href should always end in `.html`
    
    + finally -- we can use a `menu:` key to build a the dropdown menu you saw in our site earlier. This dropdown menu has two items, each links to a lab page. 


+ And then there's an output section: 
we had this before too. ANy keys we apply here will apply to all other parts of our site -- so *this* is why our index.Rmd's YAML was optional.

So, for the most minimal R Markdown site, the minimum required files are index and _site.yml.

It is optional, (but likely) that you'll want to add other RMD pages to your collection.

Okay, we're finally, ready to share our R MArkdown site -- we'll do this the same way as before. All of our HTML, website-ready pages are stored in the _site/ folder. So This this is the only folder, we need to ddrag and drop 

---
class: center, middle

&lt;video width="1316" height="630" controls&gt;
    &lt;source src="images/rmd-site-dnd.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;

And we will drop that folder back into netlify to make our site.

But if we do nothing else, this site will only exist for 24 hours. We need to make a Netlify account to make it stick.

&lt;video width="1510" height="638" controls&gt;
    &lt;source src="images/netlify-account.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

???

So let's go back to Netlify and do that. 

If you already use GitHub or GitBucket, then I recommend you use that to sign in becuase you're workflow will be smoother if your accounts are connected. But for today, I'm just going to sign up with email...

Once you've signed up, you'll see you have an account dashboard. And your silly-named link is now here to stay.

Once we've re-built our site wiith the changes we want. We'll go back to our _site/ folder. 

In netlify, we can make sure we are in the "deploy" tab of our dashboard -- and there's a spot specifically for updating. WE can drag and drop again here. 

We click on the link--and see our new theme has been applied.

# Thoughts on R Markdown Sites

???

You now know how to build and update an R Markdown site. There are a few additional considerations I want to point out. 

---
template: clouds2
class: middle center

## No Subfolders

&lt;https://github.com/apreshill/data-vis-labs-2018&gt;

![](https://dcossyleon.github.io/gifs/video/stay-organized1.gif)&lt;!-- --&gt;

???

The first is that RMD sites will not automatically Build RMD files that are contained in subfolders. This means that all RMDS have to be in the project root directory. 

If you have a lot of files you want to link to in your course, keeping your project tidy can start to feel tricky. That's why this repository of an RMD site that i'm showing you here looks so full. 

One solution you can use in this scenario is to have good file-naming hygiene: consistently use number pre-fixing to keep your files in order.

Here you get to see a bit of what a Distill site looks like, and actually the site I'm showing you is the documentation site for Distill itself. 

The design that you see is the out-of-the-box styling that you get. It's not easy to change or customize this, but it looks pretty sleek, so this doens't matter too much.

Distill is basically an R MArkdown site's sibling but with more technical and scientific interests. 

It has almost the exact same structure, but it comes with some built-in features that make it easier to author math and science content.

For example...

---
template: clouds2

&lt;https://rstudio.github.io/distill/&gt;

At a minimum, I recommend having a `title:`, but including a short description or tagline is nice too. 

It's also possible to add multiple authors to any Distill page, which could be useful if you're co-teaching (or if you decide to have students form groups to author their own Distill articles)

The YAML keys here are all very similar, with one important change.

The output MUST specify that this is a Distill article. This is how the site knows to apply the Distill styling and framework. 

Other than this, you can take any of your existing RMD documents, clean out its individual frontmatter YAML at the top, and plop it into your Distill navbar key to implement it as a Distill article.

A page on your site that compiles a chronological listing of R Markdown posts. 

For a course, let's say that after every class, you'd like to post notes or announcements about that day's lesson. With a blog, you can do that easily -- 

The most recently updated R MArkdown doc will pop to the top. This creates a student-centered approach to designing website content -- because students will always be able to tell what has been recently updated. This is not always the case with non-blog style pages.

But we need a way to tell our Distill site that this post exists. We create a listing page -- a content-less page whose only job is to compile all the posts we've authored and knit. 

We create a listings page in our root directory. The RMD file can be called anything -- the only critical piece is that it have this listing key in its YAML.

new session forces bookdown to do what is called knit then merge

strongly recommend

K-M uses separate R sessions for individual chapters

each chapter compiles from a clean state, including packages loaded

Without it, you would need to make sure that you don't have any duplicate chunk labels throughout your ENTIRE book.

BUT K-M does not allow Rmd files to be in subdirectories,

In our first week together,

Main points- the Rmd chapters don't have any YAML. This will mean that you'll need to change any individual Rmd that you want to make into chapters.

???

For example... a directory that looks like this.

Your RMDs will be in the root. The first one is still index.Rmd. This becomes the first page of your book. Usually an preface or Intro.

The REst of the RMDs are numbered. These each become book chapters. 

---
# Do I need to change the RMDs?

Yes. 

* You (might) need to rename all the files to have a numerical order. 
* All chapter .Rmd files MUST begin with a `# Level 1 Header` no matter what. No front matter YAMLS.

# ...here's why

(maybe if time allows)

.pull-right[

+ Don't update your Hugo theme during your course.

.pull-right[

+ Seriously, just don't update anything during your course.

Can't get anywhere else

+ Subdirectories

+ Ability to "knit" all output formats (like R Markdown slides, plain Rmd documents, etc.) with single button

+ Ability to "serve" all outputs on a single site

# Here's a shortcut you can use

Deploy to netlify link

# Review

Need four square view with static screenshots of each of the 4 sites

???

Say out loud which folder to drag and drop for each (maybe have the text show up in each of the four squares like `site/`, `_book/`, `public/`)

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Advice

+ build, don't knit (generally)

+ know your site's output directory!

+ publish early and update often, don't wait

---

# the options

???

which options work best for whom?

---

# Other links, resources, stuff

Looking ahead:

Connect netlify to github and use continuous deployment for your sites

Link out to gh repo for all the things? I can make issues with resources for each tool
