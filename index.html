With that in mind, we hope to give you a quick tour today of how to get your course materials online in the *fastest* way possible.

And it's made up of some metadata, which we call the YAML.
Text in the form of markdown
and oftentimes, code.

# What does a *shareable* Rmd look like?

Use kap for a gif --- should end at produced HTML

And your RMD is easily sharable when you knit it to HTML. 
So we click Knit and...

Voila! We have an HTML file that looks like a webpage. 

but this is still trapped on your computer--it's not yet online. 
There is no *link* to give learners so they can access this content.

Our R Markdown page is now alive on the internet. And this is the link where it lives. 
Has kind of a crazy name, but you can now send this to whomever you'd like.

# `site: rmarkdown::default_site`


???

I didn't know argument existed (but in hindsight, of course there's an explicit site generation function for rmd sites). If we are trying to pare down, I wonder whether including this line of code in the RMD site case will makes things feel more complicated than they are. I think we will get more buy in

# A Bookdown site

Looks like this...

[quick gif tour, not full screen, the sample site]
[just a "have you seen me before?"]

???

Some new features to point out during "tour" :
* A very long TOC
* Chapters 
* Sections

# How to get it

```
#install.packages("bookdown")
library(bookdown)
```

# Key Files


All your RMD content 

--

3 YAMLs

-- 

1 of them is index.Rmd

---

???

Brace yourselves because the bookdown structure is weirder than what we've seen. 



# Key Files

## Where do my RMD Files GO?

![](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/images/screenshots/bookdown-skeleton-files.jpg)
???

For example... a directory that looks like this.

Your RMDs will be in the root. The first one is still index.Rmd. This becomes the first page of your book. Usually an preface or Intro.

The REst of the RMDs are numbered. These each become book chapters. 

---
# Do I need to change the RMDs?

Yes. 

* You (might) need to rename all the files to have a numerical order. 
* All chapter .Rmd files MUST begin with a `# Level 1 Header` no matter what. No front matter YAMLS.

---

# ...here's why

(maybe if time allows)

![](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/images/illos/Bookdown-file-flow.jpg)

---

# How does bookdown know what to do with the rest?

The other 3 YAMLS

### `_output.yml`

### `_bookdown.yml`

### The YAML in `index.Rmd`

???

include a Graphic which bullets which doc lets you change what

* To hide a chapter while it is in progress, put it in a subfolder or start the .Rmd filename with an `_`.

---

# Share

Build your book with the Build tab. 

_book/ --&gt; drag and drop

???

By now you probably get the picture.

---

# Pros and Cons of Bookdown

.pull-left[

* Long-form content friendly
* Clear ordering of content
* Cross-references
* Numbered figures, equations, tables

]

.pull-right [

* Three YAMLS (time consuming to set up)
* Project directory will have many RMDs and no good way to organize them into subdirectories
* Not easy to customize styling

# Blogdown

...is more intense, but here's what's possible.

We won't go into the key files for this, but a main PRO of blogdown is that you get to have organized directories and subdirections. 

* Junk drawer vs Container Store
