I am a developmental psychologist

Desirée is a neuroscientist

Neither of us is a web developer

But we both ship a lot of websites for teaching data science.

Here are just a few of them.

Here's who we think you are...

* You're an educator

* You have R Markdown files for teaching...

* But they're stuck on your computer, and you need to share them easily with others. 

* And--- you probably have a new classroom space that looks like this-- so sharing needs to be done 100% online

## Why make a course website?

--

&lt;img src="images/rawpixel/fortress.jpg" width="444" /&gt;

???

+ Shareable

+ Reproducible

+ Resilient

Why make a course website at all?  It makes your content shareable, reproducible, and resilient [to short-notice changes]

Saving here for now:
The good news is that R markdown is made for sharing

R Markdown can be knitted into websites

and websites can be shared easily with a single link

But before we talk about full course website, first we need to talk about single R Markdown files. So I'll pass it off to Desiree to get us started.

# What does an .Rmd look like?

Jumping right in, what *does* an R Markdown file look like?

---
class: center, middle

&lt;img src="images/screenshots/Rproj1.png" width="544" /&gt;

???

Here is an r project folder for a lab. 

---
class: center middle

&lt;img src="images/screenshots/Rproj2.png" width="544" /&gt;


???
Inside that folder, you'll notice an RProj file. Opening that file in RStudio... 

---
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd.png)
background-size: contain
class: middle, center

???

...takes us here, where we can see our single R Markdown file for our lab. This one is for a lab for visualizing data from the Museum of Modern Art.

Let's quickly walk through some of the key parts of this file.

---
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd0.png)
background-size: contain
class: middle, center

???

It starts with metadata, written in YAML, which is a list of keys on the left and their values on the right.

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd1.png)
background-size: contain

???

The first key you see is the TITLE, which is `Lab 02: MoMA Museum Tour`.

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd2.png)
background-size: contain

???

The last YAML section is all about output. Here the output is an html document.


---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd3.png)
background-size: contain

???

Beneath that, we can add options to our html document -- for example, a table of contents, with the key TOC set to TRUE. 

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd4.png)
background-size: contain

???

So that's the metadata, but the real meat in your R Markdown file 
is text written in markdown...


---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd5.png)
background-size: contain


???

and your code, written in R.

So these 3 things: metadata, text, and code make up an R Markdown document.

???

ALISON says:

Of course, Desiree, the real magic happens, when you click on the Knit icon, and see your file turned into HTML. 

So, here's what that looks like: 

+ We knit
+ We can watch in this bottom pane as our R Markdown document gets processed.
+ And voila! -- we see our rendered HTML file. 
+ We can choose to open this up in a real browser window.
+ And then just test a few things out. 

---
class: middle center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-knit1.png)

Here is what we knit.

&lt;img src="images/screenshots/Single-knit2.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 91%; 
  top: -53px;
  right: 5px;
"&gt;

???

Using the **theme** key in our YAML, we changed our font and colors.

--

&lt;img src="images/screenshots/Single-knit3.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 97%; 
  top: -45px;
  right: -51px;
"&gt;

???

And we have this nice table of contents floating off to the side.

--

&lt;img src="images/screenshots/Single-knit4.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 73%; 
  bottom: 10px;
  right: 80px;
"&gt;

???

But this is still local and stuck on my computer. 

A **link** would make it easier to share.

## What does a .emphasis[linkable] Rmd look like?

&lt;img src="images/hello-index.jpg" width="570" /&gt;

???

So then what does a *linkable* RMD look like? There are two pre-requisites: 

1. You have to make sure we have an R Markdown document is named `index.Rmd` -- an internet browser will always begin by looking for a file named index to open up first.

ALISON says:

So, I open up my browser, and go to app.netlify.com/drop -- 

and  drag n drop the folder in. 

A few seconds later, Netlify has  auto-generated a silly-name link and deployed our page -- this link is where our Lab02 page now lives,  and you can share your page with whomever you choose --  

BOTH: hooray!

## Build your site

```r

*├── rstats101.Rproj
├── _site.yml
├── index.Rmd 
├── schedule.Rmd 
├── lab01.Rmd
└── lab02.Rmd
```
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="images/rproj.png" width="325" /&gt;

]
???

So let's build a minimal R Markdown site of our own. 

Imagine that this box on the left is the list of files that are inside of our R Project folder. 

---
name: build5

## Build your site

.left-column[


```r
.
├── rstats101.Rproj

├── index.Rmd 
├── schedule.Rmd 
├── lab01.Rmd 
└── lab02.Rmd 
```
]

.right-column[
&lt;img src="images/screenshots/build-site.png" style="margin-top: -28px;"&gt;
]

???

To knit all these pages in our R Markdown site, you can mouse over to the Build Tab in RStudio and then click "Build Website".

---
name: build6

## Build your site

.left-column[


```r
.
├── rstats101.Rproj
*├── _site/
├── _site.yml 
├── index.Rmd

├── lab01.Rmd 
└── lab02.Rmd 
```
]

.right-column[
&lt;img src="images/screenshots/build-site.png" style="margin-top: -28px;"&gt;
]

???

Now you can see that it created a new folder called `_site`- that is where our html files live.


---
template: clouds2
class: center top

![](images/screenshots/RMD-site.png)

???

Here is the site we just built. We have a navbar, a theme -- and even a dropdown menu!

Let's look under the hood at some of these files.

---
background-image: url("images/rawpixel/bunch-balloons-rmd1.jpg")

├── _site.yml
*├── index.Rmd
├── schedule.Rmd 
├── lab01.Rmd
└── lab02.Rmd
```
]

???

Let's start with index.Rmd. 

Index is a special file name in any website- because it is the homepage.  

So if each of our R Markdown files in our site was a hot air balloon here, `index` would be the first you would see. 

---
background-image: url(images/Clouds2.jpg)
background-size: cover

## Inside the `index.Rmd`

.left-column[

```r

├── _site.yml
*├── index.Rmd
├── schedule.Rmd 
├── lab01.Rmd

```
]

.right-column[
```
---
title: "rstats 101"
---

# Welcome to the course!

This is the course website...
```
]


???

If we take a peek inside index.Rmd, we don't see anything special-

in fact, you can take any existing R Markdown document that you already have, rename it index, and turn it into your site's homepage.



---
background-image: url("images/rawpixel/bunch-balloons-rmd2.jpg")
background-position: right
background-size: contain
class: middle


.left-column[

```r
.
├── rstats101.Rproj
├── _site/ 
*├── _site.yml
├── index.Rmd 
├── schedule.Rmd 
├── lab01.Rmd
└── lab02.Rmd
```
]

???

The `_site.yml` is new. 

This is the file that ties all the pages together.

It is called the site configuration file, written in YAML.

Let's take a look inside...

---

## Inside the `_site.yml`

.left-column[

```yaml
navbar:
  title: rstats101
  left:
  - text: Schedule
    href: schedule.html
  - text: Labs
    menu:
    - text: Lab 1
      href: lab01.html
    - text: Lab 2
      href: lab02.html
output:
  html_document:
    theme: flatly
```
]

.right-column[
&lt;img src="images/screenshots/RMD-site-annotated.png" width="805" /&gt;
]


???

(no index.Rmd label)

The first thing you may notice is this is a YAML file, so there are no fences, but it is a list of keys and values.

The first key is navbar, and this is how you build your site's navigation.

[increment]

Say: there is key for the title... (BING)

Show: arrow to title

[increment]

Say: whether we want links on the left or right... (BING)

Show: brackets above left side [LEFT!]

[increment]

Say: And if we want links listed in a dropdown menu, we can do that too... (BING)

Show: brackets above dropdown [MENU!]

For all the pages you link to in your navbar, the `href` needs to point to an .html file, even though the source may be R Markdown.

Finally, we set up a theme that applies to the navbar and all pages.

As for the other R Markdown pages, there is nothing special about *them*. 

As long as you link to a page in `_site.yml`, you can take any existing R Markdown file and turn it into a page within a website.

quiz Alison, what do you think the YAML for this page looks like??

Answer:

toc
toc_float
and code download (be sure screenshot is taken after clicking on code download button so the drop down shows up like: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2OwEBxUYAAG3YN?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096)

Good job, Alison!

That is exactly what we see. You can set the YAML for each page if you want.

If you wanted these output options on every page in your site, we could have added these to the `_site.yml` instead.

Okay, we're finally, ready to share our R MArkdown site -- we'll do this the same way as before. All of our HTML, website-ready pages are stored in the _site/ folder. So This this is the only folder, we need to ddrag and drop

ALISON

If you already use GitHub or BitBucket, then I recommend you use that to sign in becuase you're workflow will be smoother if your accounts are connected. But for today, I'm just going to sign up with email...

Once you've signed up, you'll see you have an account dashboard. And your silly-named link is now here to stay.

We click on the link--and see our new theme has been applied.

# Thoughts on R Markdown Sites

???

You now know how to build and update an R Markdown site. There are a few additional considerations I want to point out. 

---
class: middle
background-image: url(images/rawpixel/balloon-ouch.jpg)
background-position: left
background-size: contain

.pull-right[
### The good

* Source stays same

* Built-in themes

### The bad

* No Subfolders

]

???
So in summary for RMD site, 
You don't have to change much from your original docs. 
You get to use built in themes

One not to great thing is that you can't use subfolders -- which means you can end up with a lot of files in your directory. That can get messy, but that's how it is.


With those points in mind, let's move on to our next tool.


---

# `install.packages("distill")`

???

Our next stop on Markdown Mountain is Distill, which you'll need to install before you can use it. 

---
class: middle, center

&lt;https://rstudio.github.io/distill/&gt;

&lt;video width="1094" height="600" controls&gt;
    &lt;source src="images/distill-tour.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt; &lt;/video&gt;

???

This is a distill website.

The style is not easy to change without CSS, but it looks pretty slick out-of-the-box.

Think of distill as the nerdier sibling of an R Markdown site- it is built for technical and scientific communication. 

For example...

---
class: middle, center
template: clouds2

&lt;https://rstudio.github.io/distill/&gt;
&lt;img src="images/screenshots/distill-authors.png" style="margin-top: -28px;"&gt;

???

There's a way to list multiple authors and their affiliations...

---

template: clouds2

&lt;https://rstudio.github.io/distill/&gt;
&lt;img src="images/screenshots/distill-aside.png" style="margin-top: -28px;"&gt;

You can include footers and asides...

---

template: clouds2

&lt;https://rstudio.github.io/distill/&gt;
&lt;img src="images/screenshots/distill-reuse.png" style="margin-top: -28px;"&gt;

And you can display reuse licenses for your educational content.

```
]

.right-column[
&lt;img src="images/screenshots/build-distill.png" style="margin-top: -28px;"&gt;
]


???

So now let's build a minimal Distill site of our own. 

Just like we did with the R Markdown site, we use the build tab to knit all our files at once.

This creates a `_site` folder for our HTML files.

---

Quick things to notice -- let's look inside.

```
]

???

The index page in a distill site will work just the same as in an R Markdown site. 

It will be the site's home page. 

Any existing R Markdown document you have will do.

But there is one addition we make inside of this file. 

---
## Inside the `index.Rmd`

.left-column[

```r

```
]


???

`site: distill::distill_website` should be added to the YAML.

Including a title and short description is nice too. 

[*note*: `site: distill::website` is only necessary if you wanna make the blog later]

Next we move on to the _site.yml page. It's still for site configuration. This should sound a bit familiar...

    - text: Project
      menu: project.html
*output: distill::distill_article
```
]


???

The YAML navbar keys here are all similar to what we used in an R Markdown site, with one important change:

The output **must** specify that this is a Distill article.

And.. there is one more thing I need to tell you.

---

#  A Distill Blog

Part of your Distill site can be in a blog format!

---

background-image: url(images/Clouds2.jpg)
background-size: cover

&lt;img src="https://rstudio.github.io/distill/images/site-listing.png" style = "width: 80%;"&gt;

???

You can have a single page made up of clickable posts, like this.
Each post is itself its own page, and it doesn't need to be built into the navigation bar.  

---
## Add a listing page

.left-column[

```r
.
├── DataViz101.Rproj
├── _site/
├── _site.yml
├── index.Rmd
├── lab1.Rmd 
├── lab2.Rmd 
├── project.Rmd 
*└── schedule.Rmd

```

]

.right-column[
```
---
listing: posts
---
```
]

???

Instead, we create a listing page -- an R Markdown document whose only job is to have this listing YAML key and value.

We'll call our "schedule".

---
## Update the `_site.yml`

.left-column[

```r
.
├── DataViz101.Rproj
├── _site/
*├── _site.yml
├── index.Rmd
├── lab1.Rmd 
├── lab2.Rmd 
├── project.Rmd 
└── schedule.Rmd
```

]

.right-column[

```r
title: Data Viz
navbar:
  right:
    - text: Labs
      menu: 
      - text: Lab 1
        href: lab01.html
      - text: Lab 2
        href: lab02.html
    - text: Project
      menu: project.html
*   - text: Schedule
*     menu: schedule.html
output: distill::distill_article
```
]

???

Then, we link our listing page to navigation bar.

Now we are ready to make some posts.

---
background-image: /*url("images/rawpixel/bunch-balloons-rmd4.jpg")*/
background-position: right
background-size: contain

## Create a post

├── Project1.Rmd 
├── Project2.Rmd
*└── _posts/
```
]

.pull-right[

```r
distill::create_post("Week1")
```
]

???

In your console, run the `distill::create_post( )` function, and give your post a title in quotes. 

This will make a new folder called posts/ and open up new R Markdown file for you to edit.

You can rinse and repeat -- creating as many new posts as you'd like. 

Let's look inside one.

---

## Inside a post

.left-column[

```r
_posts/ 
*├── Week1/
* ├── Week1.Rmd

└── Week3/
```

```
---
title: Week 1
date: 03-24-2020
output: distill::distill_article
---

During our first week we will 
make our first plots with `ggplot2`.
```
]

???

The YAML of your post will be automatically populated with the appropriate keys. 

Now you can past in the body content of any existing R Markdown file into your post, **knit**, and you'll be good to go. 

Unfortunately, each posts **does** have to be knit individually.

---
## Build once more

```
]

.right-column[
&lt;img src="images/screenshots/build-distill.png" style="margin-top: -28px;"&gt;
]

???

Build once more, so that your listing page will be updated with the new posts. And now you're ready to share your site.

---

Screenshot drag and drop _site/ to netlify

The index.Rmd file is special. It is both the first chapter, and contains some YAML for the book's metadata like the title. You can think of this as the mega-YAML for your book- it is the YAML for all the chapters.

new session forces bookdown to do what is called knit then merge

strongly recommend

K-M uses separate R sessions for individual chapters

each chapter compiles from a clean state, including packages loaded

Without it, you would need to make sure that you don't have any duplicate chunk labels throughout your ENTIRE book.

BUT K-M does not allow Rmd files to be in subdirectories,

For example... a directory that looks like this.

The REst of the RMDs are numbered. These each become book chapters.

Yes.
