Alison is a developmental psychologist

Desirée is a neuroscientist

Neither of us is a web developer

But we both ship a lot of websites for teaching data science.

Here are just a few of them.

## Why make a course website?

--

```{r why-site, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rawpixel/fortress.jpg")
```

???

+ Shareable

+ Reproducible

+ Resilient

Why make a course website at all?  It makes your content shareable, reproducible, and resilient [to short-notice changes]

Saving here for now:
The good news is that R markdown is made for sharing

R Markdown can be knitted into websites

and websites can be shared easily with a single link

But before we talk about full course website, first we need to talk about single R Markdown files. So I'll pass it off to Desiree to get us started. 

---
template: clouds

# What does an .Rmd file look like?

???

Jumping right in, let's take a look at a single R Markdown file for a Lab lesson.

---
class: center, middle

```{r single-rmd, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/Rproj1.png")
```

???

Let's start by opening up the folder where the specific lab content lives.

---
class: center middle

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/Rproj2.png")
```


???
and inside of it, you'll notice that this folder is an **R Project** (which we strongly recommend you use).

We can click on the RProj file, which will port us into RStudio... 

---
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd.png)
background-size: contain
class: middle, center

???

...where we can see our single R Markdown file for our lab. 

---
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd0.png)
background-size: contain
class: middle, center

???

And it's made up of some metadata, which we call the YAML. The YAML has different "keys".

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd1.png)
background-size: contain

???

One of these Keys is the TITLE, and we say that it gets the *value* of `Lab 02: MoMA Museum Tour`.

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd2.png)
background-size: contain

???

Our YAML also has a section all about output. Here's where we specify what format we want (in this case, an HTML document). 


---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd3.png)
background-size: contain

???

But we can also spell out some output options as well -- like whether we'd like a table of contents to be automatically generated.  

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd4.png)
background-size: contain

???

The rest of the R Markdown document might have some text in the form of markdown.

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd5.png)
background-size: contain

???

and oftentimes, code. 


???

So this is an R Markdown document --but it doesn't yet look like something we'd want to share.

---
template: clouds

# What does a .emphasis[shareable] .Rmd look like?

---
class: top center

<video width="1530" height="610" controls>
    <source src="images/single-doc-knit.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

???

Of course, the real magic happens, when we click on the Knit icon, and see our file turned into HTML. 

So, here's what that looks like: 

+ We knit
+ We can watch in this bottom pane as our R Markdown document gets processed.
+ And voila! -- we see our rendered HTML file. 
+ We can choose to open this up in a real browser window.
+ And then just test a few things out. 

---
class: middle center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-knit1.png)
background-size: contain

--

<img src="images/screenshots/Single-knit2.png" style="

  top: -53px;
  right: 5px;

--

<img src="images/screenshots/Single-knit3.png" style="

  width: 97%;

  right: -51px;

--

<img src="images/screenshots/Single-knit4.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 73%; 
  bottom: 10px;
  right: 80px;
">

???

Okay, so here's a screenshot of the same rendered file in our browser, and now we can see how some of the keys in our YAML affected our document: 

+ The font and colors that we see are from a theme that we added in the output. 

+ And we also have this nice table of contents that sticks to the left side of the window -- that's also from options that we set in our YAML.

This looks great, and is now in a format that we probably wouldn't mind sharing--BUT--- it's still local and stuck on our computer. This up here is just the file path to where this HTML file lives in my R project.

We need a **link** that we can give our learners. 

---
class: center middle

## What does a .emphasis[linkable] Rmd look like?

--

```{r hello-index, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hello-index.jpg")
```

???

So then what does a *linkable* RMD look like? There are two pre-requisites: 

First, you have to make sure we have an R Markdown document is named `index.Rmd` -- an internet browser will always begin by looking for a file named index to open up first. 

---
background-image: url("images/Server.jpg")

  border-radius: 50%;

???

Second, we need a web server, which is basically (as Heather Nolis described it at her conf talk this year)--- [CLICK] a big computer in the clouds.

(h/t Heather Nolis: https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/we-re-hitting-r-a-million-times-a-day-so-we-made-a-talk-about-it-heather-nolis-dr-jacqueline-nolis)

For this webinar, we'll use servers provided by Netlify.

```{r single-dnd, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://dcossyleon.github.io/gifs/video/single-doc-dnd.gif")
```

???

So we can go to app.netlify.com/drop -- and have the R Project folder with our RMD content ready to drop in. And netlify does the rest of the work for us. Giving us a link. And our site is there!

**Say "don't close out of this page"??**

Sharing your R Markdown means three things:

1. Have an index.Rmd

1. Knit to HTML

1. Transfer to web server

Once you have at minimum the _site.yml and the index.RMd
You can mouse over to the Build tab, which give you  HTML-website ready files in a folder called "_site"

But if we do nothing else, this site will only exist for 24 hours. We need to make a Netlify account to make it stick.

So let's go back to Netlify and do that. 
Here's a gif of me doing this in one, two, three steps....

Now we can rest asssured that this link is here to stay, and we can share it with others.

### Pros

* Source stays same

* Built-in themes (Bootstrap)

* Low dependencies

--

.pull-right[

### Cons

* No Rmds in folders

* Update navbar manually

* 1 content flavor

???

So in summary for RMD site, 
You don't have to change much from your original docs. 
You get to use built in themes from bootstrap

Here's a Distill site...and it's actually very similar to a RMD site, but it has some features built-in that make it especially good for technical and scientific content. ANd I'll show you an example of that in a second. 

Another great optional feature of Distill that is worth pointing out, is the ability to organize content into a blog format.

A Distill site without blog content needs the same minimum files as an RMD site. 

**Minimum** required files:

1. `index.Rmd` = Homepage

1. `_site.yml` = Navbar

But for the blog-like feature, you need a Blog Listing RMD, a folder, named posts/ which then contains a directory for each post you make.

# Where is the site?

actually the same as Rmd site!

The index.Rmd file is special. It is both the first chapter, and contains some YAML for the book's metadata like the title. You can think of this as the mega-YAML for your book- it is the YAML for all the chapters.

Main points- the Rmd chapters don't have any YAML. This will mean that you'll need to change any individual Rmd that you want to make into chapters.

For example... a directory that looks like this.

Your RMDs will be in the root. The first one is still index.Rmd. This becomes the first page of your book. Usually an preface or Intro.

The REst of the RMDs are numbered. These each become book chapters. 

---
# Do I need to change the RMDs?

Yes. 

* You (might) need to rename all the files to have a numerical order. 
* All chapter .Rmd files MUST begin with a `# Level 1 Header` no matter what. No front matter YAMLS.

# ...here's why

(maybe if time allows)

We won't go into the key files for this, but a main PRO of blogdown is that you get to have organized directories and subdirections. 

* Junk drawer vs Container Store

# Advice

+ build, don't knit (generally)

+ know where your site lives locally

+ publish early and update often, don't wait

---

# the options

![](images/mtsalsa-hi-square.jpg)

which options work best for whom?

---

# Other links, resources, stuff

Looking ahead:

Connect netlify to github and use continuous deployment for your sites

Link out to gh repo for all the things? I can make issues with resources for each tool
