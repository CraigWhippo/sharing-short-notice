* But those files are stuck on your computer, and you need to share them easily with other people.

# Sharing on **short notice**


???

With that in mind, we hope to give you a quick tour today of how to get your course materials online in the *fastest* way possible.

(aka not necessarily using longterm best practices, but prioritizing things that are possible to get done in a pinch)

Why make a course website at all?  It makes your content shareable, reproducible, and resilient (<-- how?)

second column? You might think the downsides are that this requires....

# Good news

R markdown is made for sharing

???

Luckily, R Markdown is made for sharing

---

# Better news

HTML makes sharing even easier with a `r emo::ji("star")`link`r emo::ji("star")` and...

--

R Markdown can be knitted into HTML! `r emo::ji("rocket")`


???

What's the transition here?

---

# What does sharing look like?

(gif of file window, click on .Rproj file to open and open up index.Rmd; have TOC floating and flatly theme already done)

???

Let's start with a single Rmd file, inside an folder that is also an R project

Here's what an RMD looks like. 

---

# What does an Rmd look like?

screenshot of index.Rmd source file inside RStudio, annotated w/:

metadata = YAML

text = markdown

???

And it's made up of some metadata, which we call the YAML.
Text in the form of markdown
and oftentimes, code. 

---

# What does a *shareable* Rmd look like?

gif- knit to html

???

Use kap for a gif --- should end at produced HTML

And your RMD is easily sharable when you knit it to HTML. 
So we click Knit and...

# What does a *shareable* Rmd look like?

???

Voila! We have an HTML file that looks like a webpage. 

but this is still trapped on your computer--it's not yet online. 
There is no *link* to give learners so they can access this content.

???

What does a linkable RMD look like? 
First, you have to make sure your RMD is named index.Rmd -- an internet browser will always begin by looking for a file named index to open as your homepage.

And we can take a folder that has the knitted HTML file we created,

![](images/doc-live.jpg)

Still need to include screenshot of the netlify link


???

Our R Markdown page is now alive on the internet. And this is the link where it lives. 
Has kind of a crazy name, but you can now send this to whomever you'd like.

# What just happened?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/dnd-doc.gif")
```

???

We started with an RMD file, we knit it to get our HTML version. 
Then we dragged and dropped the folder with the HTML file straight into netlify to get our link.

(I'll replace parts of this with the right screenshots so it's not all sketched -- and name RMD index). 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://summer-of-blogdown.netlify.com/01/#44")

# Sharing = knit + drop -> LINK

???

Sharing your R Markdown means three things:

1. Have an index.Rmd

1. Knit to HTML

1. Transfer to web server

# Goals

```{r echo=FALSE}

 Give you a quick tour around what is possible to do with your existing RMD docs when turning them into a site.

FAST SLIDE

# Where are we going?

We've just shown you how to go from a regular RMD doc on your computer to one that's a webpage.

We'll talk show you 4 RMD tools that are for turning a *COLLECTION* of RMDs into a website.

# `site: rmarkdown::default_site`


???

I didn't know argument existed (but in hindsight, of course there's an explicit site generation function for rmd sites). If we are trying to pare down, I wonder whether including this line of code in the RMD site case will makes things feel more complicated than they are. I think we will get more buy in

1. `index.Rmd` = Landing page

1. `_site.yml` = Navbar / theme

**Optional** but likely:

say somewhere: every .Rmd is a page, but the one named index.Rmd is a special page

# Where is the site?

# How do you share this site?

Need to make a Netlify account to make it stick.

# A Bookdown site

Looks like this...

[quick gif tour, not full screen, the sample site]
[just a "have you seen me before?"]

???

Some new features to point out during "tour" :
* A very long TOC
* Chapters 
* Sections

# How to get it

```
#install.packages("bookdown")
library(bookdown)

# Key Files


All your RMD content 

--

3 YAMLs

-- 

1 of them is index.Rmd

---

???

Brace yourselves because the bookdown structure is weirder than what we've seen. 



# Key Files

## Where do my RMD Files GO?

![](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/images/screenshots/bookdown-skeleton-files.jpg)
???

For example... a directory that looks like this.

Your RMDs will be in the root. The first one is still index.Rmd. This becomes the first page of your book. Usually an preface or Intro.

The REst of the RMDs are numbered. These each become book chapters. 

---
# Do I need to change the RMDs?

Yes. 

* You (might) need to rename all the files to have a numerical order. 
* All chapter .Rmd files MUST begin with a `# Level 1 Header` no matter what. No front matter YAMLS.

---

# ...here's why

(maybe if time allows)

![](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/images/illos/Bookdown-file-flow.jpg)

---

# How does bookdown know what to do with the rest?

The other 3 YAMLS

### `_output.yml`

### `_bookdown.yml`

### The YAML in `index.Rmd`

???

include a Graphic which bullets which doc lets you change what

* To hide a chapter while it is in progress, put it in a subfolder or start the .Rmd filename with an `_`.

---

# Share

Build your book with the Build tab. 

_book/ --> drag and drop

???

By now you probably get the picture.

---

# Pros and Cons of Bookdown

.pull-left[

* Long-form content friendly
* Clear ordering of content
* Cross-references
* Numbered figures, equations, tables

]

.pull-right [

* Three YAMLS (time consuming to set up)
* Project directory will have many RMDs and no good way to organize them into subdirectories
* Not easy to customize styling

# Blogdown

We won't go into the key files for this, but a main PRO of blogdown is that you get to have organized directories and subdirections. 

* Junk drawer vs Container Store
