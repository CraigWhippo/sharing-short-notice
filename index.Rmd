Alison is a developmental psychologist

Desirée is a neuroscientist

Neither of us is a web developer

But we both ship a lot of websites for teaching data science.

Here are just a few of them.

## Why make a course website?

--

```{r why-site, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rawpixel/fortress.jpg")
```

???

+ Shareable

+ Reproducible

+ Resilient

Why make a course website at all?  It makes your content shareable, reproducible, and resilient [to short-notice changes]

Saving here for now:
The good news is that R markdown is made for sharing

R Markdown can be knitted into websites

and websites can be shared easily with a single link

BUT BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT FULL COURSE WEBSITES, FIRST WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT A SINGLE RMD FILE....SO I'LL PASS IT OFF TO DESIREE TO LEAD US THROUGH THAT.

# What does an R Markdown Project look like?

???

Getting started, it's always a good idea to use an R Project, which is this 
---
ALL BLUE FOLDERS....
RPOJECT. MOMA
INDEX.RMD

???
LET'S OPEN A FOLDER [SS] AND TAKE A LOOK INSTIDE AND GO INSIDE THE RPOJECT IN RSTUDIO [SS RAW FILE]

HAVE IT ALREADY BE NAMED INDEX.

???

TRANSITION TO DESIREE

Let's start with a single Rmd file, inside an folder that is also an R project



---
class: middle, center

## An .Rmd

```{r single-rmd, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/Single-rmd.jpg")
```

???

Here's what an RMD looks like....

---
class: middle, center

## An .Rmd


```{r single-rmd1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/Single-rmd1.jpg")
```


???

And it's made up of some metadata, which we call the YAML...

---
class: middle, center 

## An .Rmd

```{r single-rmd2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/Single-rmd2.jpg")
```

???

Text in the form of markdown

---
class: center middle

## An .Rmd

```{r single-rmd3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/Single-rmd3.jpg")
```

???

and oftentimes, code. 

---
template: clouds

# What does a .emphasis[shareable] .Rmd look like?

---
class: middle center

## A .emphasis[shareable] .Rmd

```{r single-rmd-knit, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://dcossyleon.github.io/gifs/video/single-doc-knit.gif")
```

???

Let's knit our RMD source file and see. 
We click Knit and...we get an HTML file.

---
class: middle center

## A .emphasis[shareable] .Rmd

```{r single-knit1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/Single-knit1.jpg")
```

???
Voila! We have an HTML file that looks like a webpage. 
but this is still trapped on your computer--it's not yet online. 

---
class: middle center

## A .emphasis[shareable] .Rmd

```{r single-knit2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/Single-knit2.jpg")
```

???

There is no *link* to give learners so they can access this content.
This is just the local filepath to the HTML file.


---
class: center middle

## What does a .emphasis[linkable] Rmd look like?

--

```{r hello-index, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hello-index.jpg")
```

???

So thenk what does a *linkable* RMD look like? 
First, you have to make sure your RMD is named index.Rmd -- an internet browser will always begin by looking for a file named index because that's what it uses as a homepage.

???

So we can go to app.netlify.com/drop -- and have the R Project folder with our RMD content ready to drop in. And netlify does the rest of the work for us. Giving us a link. And our site is there!

**Say "don't close out of this page"??**

Sharing your R Markdown means three things:

1. Have an index.Rmd

1. Knit to HTML

1. Transfer to web server

Here's what one looks like out in the wild. 

A website made up of many individual R Markdown documents.

Some of which are now connected via:

* A navbar

background-size: cover

## R Markdown site

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/RMD-site.png")
```

???

And here's a simple site that we're going to look at more closely.

---
background-image: url(images/Clouds2.jpg)
background-size: cover

## Inside the project

.left-column[
```{r eval=FALSE}
.
├── RMD-site.Rproj
├── _site.yml #<<
├── index.Rmd #<< 
├── Lab1.Rmd
```
]

.right-column[
```{r, echo=FALSE}

<img src="images/RMD-site-annotated.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 52%; 
  top: 91px;
  right: 147px;
">

???

On the left, we have  directory tree, where you can see the files in the project directory. 

**Minimum** required files:

1. `index.Rmd` = Homepage

1. `_site.yml` = Navbar / theme 

---
background-image: url(images/Clouds2.jpg)

```
]

.right-column[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/RMD-site-lab.png")
```
]

???

**Optional** but likely:

+ Other `.Rmd` files = Content 

---
name: rmd-site-yml
background-image: url(images/Clouds2.jpg)
background-size: cover

## Inside the `_site.yml`

.left-column[
```{r eval=FALSE}

├── RMD-site.Rproj
├── _site.yml #<<
├── index.Rmd
├── Lab1.Rmd
```
]

<img src="images/site.yml.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 63%; 
  top: 96px;
  right: 49px;
">


.right-column[
```{r echo=FALSE}
 yml_empty() %>%
  yml_navbar(
    title = "rstats101",
    left = list(
      navbar_page("Syllabus", href = "index.html"),
      navbar_page("Labs", href = "lab1.html")

  yml_output(html_document(toc = TRUE, toc_float = TRUE, theme = "yeti")) %>% 
  asis_yaml_output(fences = FALSE)
```
]

## Put it together and what have you got?

.pull-left[

.Rmds

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rawpixel/instruments.jpg")

.pull-right[

`_site.yml`

## Build the site

.left-column[
```{r eval=FALSE}

└── _site/ #<<
```
]

.right-column[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/build-site.jpg")
```
]



???

Once you have at minimum the _site.yml and the index.RMd
You can mouse over to the Build tab, which give you  HTML-website ready files in a folder called "_site"

---
class: middle, center

# How do you share this site?
Drag-and-drop `_site/`

class: center, middle

<video width="1530" height="610" controls>

And we will drop that folder back into netlify to make our site.

???

So let's go back to Netlify and do that. 
Here's a gif of me doing this in one, two, three steps....

Now we can rest asssured that this link is here to stay, and we can share it with others.

* Low dependencies

???

So in summary for RMD site, 
You don't have to change much from your original docs. 
You get to use built in themes from bootstrap

Here's a Distill site...and it's actually very similar to a RMD site, but it has some features built-in that make it especially good for technical and scientific content. ANd I'll show you an example of that in a second. 

Another great optional feature of Distill that is worth pointing out, is the ability to organize content into a blog format.

A Distill site without blog content needs the same minimum files as an RMD site. 

**Minimum** required files:

1. `index.Rmd` = Homepage

1. `_site.yml` = Navbar

But for the blog-like feature, you need a Blog Listing RMD, a folder, named posts/ which then contains a directory for each post you make. 

---

actually the same as Rmd site!

The index.Rmd file is special. It is both the first chapter, and contains some YAML for the book's metadata like the title. You can think of this as the mega-YAML for your book- it is the YAML for all the chapters.

Main points- the Rmd chapters don't have any YAML. This will mean that you'll need to change any individual Rmd that you want to make into chapters.

For example... a directory that looks like this.

Your RMDs will be in the root. The first one is still index.Rmd. This becomes the first page of your book. Usually an preface or Intro.

The REst of the RMDs are numbered. These each become book chapters. 

---
# Do I need to change the RMDs?

Yes. 

* You (might) need to rename all the files to have a numerical order. 
* All chapter .Rmd files MUST begin with a `# Level 1 Header` no matter what. No front matter YAMLS.

# ...here's why

(maybe if time allows)

# Pros and Cons of Bookdown

* Long-form content friendly
* Clear ordering of content
* Cross-references

.pull-right[

* Three YAMLS (time consuming to set up)
* Project directory will have many RMDs and no good way to organize them into subdirectories
* Not easy to customize styling

We won't go into the key files for this, but a main PRO of blogdown is that you get to have organized directories and subdirections. 

* Junk drawer vs Container Store
