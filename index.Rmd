# Goals

```{r echo=FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("https://picsum.photos/id/1600/900")
```
 Give you a quick tour around what is possible to do with your RMD docs when turning them into a site.

FAST SLIDE
And our goals are to show you how to quickly take that R Markdown and put it online the fastest and most straightforard way possible.

Use kap for a gif --- should end at produced HTML --> maybe next slide is freeze frame of that?
dont forget to host gif-url elsewhere

Has kind of a crazy name, but you can now send this to whomever you'd like.

need to check:  Don't you have to log in and create a netlify account otherwise domain disappears.

We've just shown you how to go from a regular RMD doc on your computer to one that's a webpage.

We'll talk show you 4 RMD tools that are for turning a *COLLECTION* of RMDs into a website.

# An RMD site

Looks like this...

# How to make it

### Add content 
This is what you know. Each RMD becomes its own page.

* index.Rmd
* Class1.Rmd
* Class2.Rmd
* Homework1.Rmd

### Put pages together
This is new, and important. It's the YAML in standalone doc form

* `_site.yml`

### Share

* All goes into one folder

---
class: middle

# _site.yml

The orchestra conductor --puts all the pages together in the way you want. How? 

--

Via the navbar.

--
    * Dropdown menus
    * Pages
    * Icons
--
   (There's a YAML line for that)

???

 * If you want it in the navbar, it's gotta be in the _site.yml

---
class: middle

# _site.yml

The conductor 

also controls artistic expression of the orchestra --

_site.yml controls this too:

--
 theme: flatly
 toc: 
 etc.
