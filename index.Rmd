# Good news

Luckily, R Markdown is made for sharing

# Better news

HTML makes sharing even easier with a `r emo::ji("star")`link`r emo::ji("star")` and...

R Markdown can be knitted into HTML! `r emo::ji("rocket")`

What's the transition here?

# What does sharing look like?

# What does an Rmd look like?

And it's made up of some metadata, which we call the YAML.
Text in the form of markdown
and oftentimes, code.

# What does a .emphasis[shareable] Rmd look like?

Use kap for a gif --- should end at produced HTML

And your RMD is easily sharable when you knit it to HTML. 
So we click Knit and...

???

Voila! We have an HTML file that looks like a webpage. 

but this is still trapped on your computer--it's not yet online. 
There is no *link* to give learners so they can access this content.

# What does a .emphasis[linkable] Rmd look like?


???

What does a linkable RMD look like? 
First, you have to make sure your RMD is named index.Rmd -- an internet browser will always begin by looking for a file named index to open as your homepage.

We started with an RMD file -->  we knit it to get our HTML version --> 
Then we dragged and dropped the folder with the HTML file straight into netlify to get our link.

(I'll replace parts of this with the right screenshots so it's not all sketched -- and name RMD index). 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://summer-of-blogdown.netlify.com/01/#44")

# Sharing = knit + drop -> LINK

Sharing your R Markdown means three things:

1. Have an index.Rmd

1. Knit to HTML

1. Transfer to web server

# So where are we going?



???

We've just shown you how to go from a regular RMD doc on your computer to one that's a web*page*.

Our goal for the rest of this webinar is to show you 4 RMD tools that are for turning a *COLLECTION* of RMDs into a web*site*.

transition slide --revisit later

So let's begin with an R Markdown site.

---

# R Markdown site

Screenshot of rendered html site (w/ theme)

???

Here's an example of what one site would look like. 

---

# R Markdown site

same screenshot, annotated

**Minimum** required files:

1. `index.Rmd` = Homepage

1. `_site.yml` = Navbar / theme 

--

**Optional** but likely:

+ Other `.Rmd` files = Content 

???

To build something like this, There are two minimum files you need:

* The homepage content comes from you have in index.Rmd
* And the navbar content and other global features like the theme, come from a file called _site.yml
* All other R Markdown documents becomes the other webpages on the site.

---

# Where is the site?

screenshot with build button highlighted

???

What do you do once you have these files?
You can mouse over to the Build tab, which will knit all your RMDs at once, pulling them together according to _site.yml.
This will put all your HTML-website ready files in a folder called "site"

---

# How do you share this site?

Drag-and-drop `_site/`

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/5pUkiGdxzKisg/giphy.gif)

???

And we will drop that folder back into netlify to make our site. 

---

# But...

(maybe a good place also for cinderella- carriage goes poof)

Only exists for 24 hours. 

Need to make a Netlify account to make it stick.


???

But if we do nothing else, this site will only exist for 24 hours. We need to make a Netlify account to make it stick. 

---

# Back to Netlify

Make an account.

???

So let's go back to Netlify and do that. 
Here's a gif of me doing this in one, two, three steps....

Now we can rest asssured that this link is here to stay, and we can share it with others.

# Inside the Rmds

.Rmd files look just like you think...

+ now there are just many of them, but 

+ remember: index is special 

???

Metadata = YAML
text = markdown
code = R


---

# Inside the `_site.yml`

```{r echo=FALSE}
yml_empty() %>%
  yml_navbar(
    title = "rstats101",
    left = list(
      navbar_page("Home", href = "index.html"),
      navbar_page("Syllabus", href = "syllabus.html")
    )) %>% 
  yml_output(html_document(toc = TRUE, toc_float = TRUE, theme = "flatly")) %>%

Say out loud- actually the same as Rmd site, minus themes based on bootstrap.

# A Bookdown site

Looks like this...

[quick gif tour, not full screen, the sample site]
[just a "have you seen me before?"]

???

Some new features to point out during "tour" :
* A very long TOC
* Chapters 
* Sections

---

# How to get it

```
#install.packages("bookdown")
library(bookdown)
```

---
# Key Files


All your RMD content 

--

3 YAMLs

-- 

1 of them is index.Rmd

---

???

Brace yourselves because the bookdown structure is weirder than what we've seen. 



# Key Files

## Where do my RMD Files GO?

![](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/images/screenshots/bookdown-skeleton-files.jpg)
???

For example... a directory that looks like this.

Your RMDs will be in the root. The first one is still index.Rmd. This becomes the first page of your book. Usually an preface or Intro.

The REst of the RMDs are numbered. These each become book chapters. 

---
# Do I need to change the RMDs?

Yes. 

* You (might) need to rename all the files to have a numerical order. 
* All chapter .Rmd files MUST begin with a `# Level 1 Header` no matter what. No front matter YAMLS.

---

# ...here's why

(maybe if time allows)

![](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/images/illos/Bookdown-file-flow.jpg)

---

# How does bookdown know what to do with the rest?

The other 3 YAMLS

### `_output.yml`

### `_bookdown.yml`

### The YAML in `index.Rmd`

???

include a Graphic which bullets which doc lets you change what

* To hide a chapter while it is in progress, put it in a subfolder or start the .Rmd filename with an `_`.

---

# Share

Build your book with the Build tab. 

_book/ --> drag and drop

???

By now you probably get the picture.

---

# Pros and Cons of Bookdown

.pull-left[

* Long-form content friendly
* Clear ordering of content
* Cross-references
* Numbered figures, equations, tables

]

.pull-right [

* Three YAMLS (time consuming to set up)
* Project directory will have many RMDs and no good way to organize them into subdirectories
* Not easy to customize styling

We won't go into the key files for this, but a main PRO of blogdown is that you get to have organized directories and subdirections. 

* Junk drawer vs Container Store
